Dr. Bothwell received his AB from Washington University and his PhD from Yale University in Sidney Altman’s lab studying RNA biogenesis in bacteria and human cells.  He did postdoctoral research at MIT in David Baltimore’s lab where he developed molecular probes for all mouse antibody genes and defined molecular properties of the murine antibody response.  He joined the Yale Medical School faculty and has studied basic properties of lymphocytes and their receptors in mouse models of infection, autoimmunity, transplantation and novel humanized mouse models of vascular disease, type 1 diabetes and cancer.<br/><br/>

## Dr. Martha Dua-Awereh
### Postdoctoral Fellow
Hailing from the Bronx, Dr. Martha Dua-Awereh graduated from Brooklyn College with her bachelors of science in Physics and Biology. During her undergarduate career, Dr. Dua-Awereh participated in many research experience for undergraduates including programs at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University. She then made the jump from the east coast to American Heartland, starting her PhD Systems Biology & Physiology at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in the lab of Dr. Yana Zavros. During her PhD, Dr. Zavros and her lab moved from Ohio to Tucson, Arizona, where the University of Arizona is located. Dr. Dua-Awereh then completed her candidacy and dissertation research at the U of A. Dr. Dua-Awereh officially joined the Bothwell Lab in the Winter of 2021. In her free time... <br/><br/>

Haley Marcarian received her bachelors of science from the University of Arizona Honors College in Molecular and Cellular Biology in the Spring of 2021. During her undergraduate career, Haley was as an undergraduate research assistant in the _________ lab investigating the intersection of catabolism and anabolism in the Gcv3 protein in yeast. She also was a preceptor and teaching assistant in the Molecular Biology teaching labs at the U of A, and participated as a Toxicology and Animal Resources intern at Incyte. Haley joined the Bothwell lab in the Winter of 2021 and is currently pursuing her PhD in Cancer Biology. For fun, Haley enjoys reading,   playing board games, and bullying Anutr.

# Undergraduate Students
## Anika Arias
### Undergraduate Research Opportunities Consortium Minimizing Health Disparities Summer Intern
Anika received her bachelors of science in Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology from the University of Arizona in the Spring of 2022. During her undergraduate career, she worked as a research assistant in the Woodson lab, studying the production of Arabidopsis quadruple mutants. She decided on the Bothwell Lab for her UROC MHD Summer Lab Rotation because the field of cancer biology was very interesting to her, as her favorite class during her undergraduate career was cancer biology.
